One of the most important things for me when working from home is having the right tools. So, let's start with my main device - the computer.

## Computer

The 32GB of RAM also ensures that multitasking is a breeze!

## Display

The dual monitor setup maximizes my web development workflow. I can code on one screen while previewing live on the other â€” no more <span class="text-xs"><Kbd>Alt</Kbd> + <Kbd>Tab</Kbd></span> necessary for faster, more efficient work!

Need a website with extra wide breakpoint? I've got you covered with my ultrawide monitor.
